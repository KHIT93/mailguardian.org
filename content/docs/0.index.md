# Welcome

Feel free to browse the documentation articles as you please, or read below to find out where to get started

## Getting started

The fastest way to get started is to follow our [quick start guide](/docs/quickstart){.font-semibold .underline} under the <strong>Getting Started</strong> section<br/>
Do not be afraid, as we promise you, it is very easy and quick to get started


If you want to know what actually happens under the hood of the quick start installation script, then feel free to look at the articles in the <strong>Installation</strong> section<br/>
Those articles will explain what happens where and what we configure for you<br/>
They will also learn you how to customize certain aspects of the installation

## For V2 only

We are still working to finish the last pieces in our documentation and aim to have it finished for release of V2
